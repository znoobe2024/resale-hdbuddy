Project Scope

Resale HDBuddy is my personal learning project to explore how AI can be applied to real-world housing data. The scope covers building a professional-looking dashboard that allows users to visualize resale flat trends, estimate prices, and even ask questions through a conversational assistant. At its heart, the project demonstrates how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can be used to ground AI answers in actual datasets, while keeping the system stable, efficient, and affordable.

Objective

•	To learn and apply the concept of RAG in a practical project.  
•	To design a dashboard that is user-friendly and professional, even for non-technical users.  
•	To understand the strengths and limitations of RAG, and how to overcome them through careful preparation, retrieval, and post-retrieval processes.  
•	To challenge myself as a 57-year-old non-techie, proving that with curiosity and persistence, I can build something meaningful with modern AI tools.

Key Features

•	Secure Login Page: A professional entry point requiring UserID and Password before accessing the dashboard.  
•	Resale Trends Visualization: Dual-axis charts showing average prices and transaction volumes by town.  
•	Price Estimator: A form where users input property details, with estimates generated using ChatGPT grounded in the dataset.  
•	HDB Assistant (Henry): A conversational interface powered by RAG, answering questions based on trend and resale data.  
•	Professional Theme: Clean layout, clear headings, disclaimers for legal safety, and a polished presentation style.

Data Sources

•	trend_data.csv: Contains yearly resale price and transaction trends by town.  
•	hdb_resale_clean.csv: Provides detailed resale flat records, including flat type, floor area, and year.  
These datasets form the backbone of the dashboard and are used to ground the AI responses in real, structured information.

How to Use This App

1.	Login: Enter the correct UserID and Password to access the dashboard.  
2.	Explore Trends: Use the multiselect option to view resale price and transaction trends for different towns.  
3.	Estimate Prices: Fill in the property details in the Price Estimator form and receive an AI-generated estimate.  
4.	Ask Henry: Type a question about resale trends, and Henry will respond with insights grounded in the datasets.  
5.	Disclaimer: Remember, this app is for demonstration and learning purposes only — it does not represent HDB or its officers.
